Welcome to the Poker Probability Calculator.

This simple program lets you draw a poker hand, mark the cards you want
to hold, and then calculates the probabilities of various hands being
drawn from what remains in the deck.

You can use this program to:
 -	Practice your poker decision skills.
 -	Count cards (just please don't cheat with it)
 -	Learn the basics of poker (especially the different hand types, and 
	their relative values.
 -	Check if your understanding of certain combinatoric and permutation 
	theory is correct (for the academics amongst us).

The combinatoric and permutation logic behind the scenes has been optimised 
to generate, classify, and compare approximately one million poker hands 
per second (depending on the machine). 
This means that calculating every possible draw/hold combination for the 
current hand should take under 3 seconds on a reasonably powerful machine. 

NOTE that the demo has certain features disabled, but all the calculations
are still accurate.

Features new to version 2.0:  
 -	Optimal strategy via payoff table calculation included
 -	Users now have the option to analyse a custom hold/draw pattern
	or have the optimal one calculated for them.
 -  Included the calculation of a return rate for video poker.
 -  Included the calculation of the odds that an opponent might draw
	a better starting hand that the player based on the state of deck.
 -	Various layout improvements (commpressed to function on smaller screen).

Features new to version 1.1:  
 -	Total hand types have been changed, instead, to a percentage draw
	chance (rather than a "1 in X" sort of thing, which wasn't helpful).
 -	User selection of Hold/Discard combos, and calculations based on those.
	Where previously only odds of redrawing the entire hand were calculated.
 -	Various layout improvements.


Planned Features
 -	Dynamic interface re-sizing, so that any screen size will work.
